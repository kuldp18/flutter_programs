To create an App Launch Icon in Flutter, you can use the `flutter_launcher_icons` package. This package simplifies the process of generating app icons for both Android and iOS platforms. Here's how to set it up:

### **Steps to Create an App Launch Icon in Flutter:**

1. **Add the `flutter_launcher_icons` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:**

   Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the `flutter_launcher_icons` dependency under `dev_dependencies`:

   ```yaml
   dev_dependencies:
     flutter_launcher_icons: ^0.9.2

   flutter_icons:
     android: true
     ios: true
     image_path: "assets/icon/app_icon.png"
   ```

   - `android: true` – generates app icons for Android.
   - `ios: true` – generates app icons for iOS.
   - `image_path: "assets/icon/app_icon.png"` – specify the location of the image you want to use as your app icon.

2. **Add your app icon image:**

   - Place the image you want to use as your app icon in the `assets/icon/` folder (you can create this folder if it doesn't exist).
   - The image should be a square (e.g., 512x512 or higher) to ensure it looks good on all devices.

   Example:

   - `assets/icon/app_icon.png`

3. **Run the `flutter_launcher_icons` package:**

   After adding the dependency and specifying the image path, run the following command to generate the icons:

   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   flutter pub run flutter_launcher_icons:main
   ```

   This command will:

   - Generate app icons for both Android and iOS.
   - Place the icons in the appropriate directories for each platform.

4. **Check your app icon:**

   After the icons are generated, you can check them in the following directories:

   - For **Android**: The icons will be placed in the `android/app/src/main/res/` directory.
   - For **iOS**: The icons will be placed in the `ios/Runner/Assets.xcassets/AppIcon.appiconset/` directory.

5. **Run your app:**

   Once the icons are generated, you can run your Flutter app on an emulator or real device to see the new app icon.

### **Example `pubspec.yaml` file:**

```yaml
name: your_app_name
description: A new Flutter project.

dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter

dev_dependencies:
  flutter_launcher_icons: ^0.9.2

flutter_icons:
  android: true
  ios: true
  image_path: "assets/icon/app_icon.png"

flutter:
  assets:
    - assets/icon/app_icon.png
```

### **Explanation:**

- `flutter_launcher_icons` is a convenient package for generating consistent app icons for both platforms.
- By specifying `image_path` in the configuration, the package generates the necessary app icons and places them in the required directories.
- The icons are generated with different resolutions for different screen densities (e.g., `mdpi`, `hdpi`, `xxhdpi`, etc. for Android).

### **Result:**

After following these steps, your Flutter app will have a custom launch icon for both Android and iOS platforms.
