In Flutter, navigation is an essential part of building mobile applications, and it allows users to move between different screens of an app. Below is a complete Flutter app to demonstrate **navigation** between multiple screens using the **Navigator** widget.

### **Folder Structure**

```
lib/
├── main.dart
├── screens/
│   ├── home_screen.dart
│   ├── second_screen.dart
│   └── third_screen.dart
```

---

### **Code for Each File**

#### 1. `main.dart`

This file contains the `main` function to start the app and define the initial route.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'screens/home_screen.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Navigation Demo',
      theme: ThemeData(primarySwatch: Colors.blue),
      home: HomeScreen(), // Initial screen
    );
  }
}
```

---

#### 2. `screens/home_screen.dart`

The home screen has buttons that navigate to two other screens: the second and third screens.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'second_screen.dart';
import 'third_screen.dart';

class HomeScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Home Screen'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: () {
                // Navigate to Second Screen
                Navigator.push(
                  context,
                  MaterialPageRoute(builder: (context) => SecondScreen()),
                );
              },
              child: Text('Go to Second Screen'),
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: () {
                // Navigate to Third Screen
                Navigator.push(
                  context,
                  MaterialPageRoute(builder: (context) => ThirdScreen()),
                );
              },
              child: Text('Go to Third Screen'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

---

#### 3. `screens/second_screen.dart`

This screen can be reached from the home screen. It has a back button that returns to the previous screen.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

class SecondScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Second Screen'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            Text('This is the second screen.'),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: () {
                // Navigate back to the Home Screen
                Navigator.pop(context);
              },
              child: Text('Go Back to Home'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

---

#### 4. `screens/third_screen.dart`

This screen can also be accessed from the home screen. It has a button to go back to the home screen.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

class ThirdScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Third Screen'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            Text('This is the third screen.'),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: () {
                // Navigate back to the Home Screen
                Navigator.pop(context);
              },
              child: Text('Go Back to Home'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

### **How It Works**

1. **Home Screen**:
   - The home screen has two buttons that use `Navigator.push` to navigate to `SecondScreen` and `ThirdScreen`.
2. **Second Screen**:
   - The second screen displays a message and has a button to navigate back to the previous screen using `Navigator.pop`.
3. **Third Screen**:
   - Similarly, the third screen displays a message and has a button to navigate back to the home screen using `Navigator.pop`.

### **Explanation of Navigation**

- **`Navigator.push`**: This function is used to push a new screen onto the stack. When navigating to a new screen, Flutter uses this method to show the new screen. The new screen becomes the active screen, and the previous one goes into the background.
- **`Navigator.pop`**: This function is used to pop the current screen off the stack and go back to the previous screen.

---

### **Run Instructions**

1. Place the files in their respective folder structure.
2. Run the app using `flutter run`.
3. You will see the **Home Screen** with two buttons:
   - One to navigate to the **Second Screen**.
   - One to navigate to the **Third Screen**.
4. On the **Second Screen** and **Third Screen**, you'll have a button to go back to the **Home Screen** using `Navigator.pop()`.

---

### **Output**

- **Home Screen**: Displays two buttons to navigate to the second and third screens.
- **Second Screen**: Displays a message with a button to go back to the previous screen.
- **Third Screen**: Displays a message with a button to go back to the previous screen.

---

### **Customization**

- You can use **named routes** instead of `MaterialPageRoute` for more structured navigation, especially in larger apps.
- You can also use **`Navigator.pushReplacement`** to replace the current screen with a new one, preventing the user from going back to the previous screen using the back button.
